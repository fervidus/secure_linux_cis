# 5.2.1 Ensure permissions on /etc/ssh/sshd_config are configured (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The /etc/ssh/sshd_config file contains configuration specifications for sshd.
# The command below sets the owner and group of the file to root.
#
# Rationale:
# The /etc/ssh/sshd_config file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes
# by non-privileged users.
#
# @summary 5.2.1 Ensure permissions on /etc/ssh/sshd_config are configured (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
