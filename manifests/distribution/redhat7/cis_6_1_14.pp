# # 6.1.14 Audit SGID executables (Not Scored)

# #
# # Description:
# # The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's permissions, even if the user running
# # the program is not the owner or a member of the group. The most common reason for a SGID program
# # is to enable users to perform functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.
