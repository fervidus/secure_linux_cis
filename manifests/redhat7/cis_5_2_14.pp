# 5.2.14 Ensure SSH access is limited (Scored)
#
# Description:
# There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system via SSH. It is recommended that at least one of
# the following options be leveraged:
#
# AllowUsers
# The AllowUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of
# space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user
# access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host.
#
# AllowGroups
# The AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list
# consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.
#
# DenyUsers
# The DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of
# space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user
# access further by specifically denying a user's access from a particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host.
#
# DenyGroups
# The DenyGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list
# consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.
#
# Rationale:
# Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only authorized users access the system.
