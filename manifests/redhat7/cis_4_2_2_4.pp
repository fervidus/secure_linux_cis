# 4.2.2.4 Ensure syslog-ng is configured to send logs to a remote log host (Not Scored)
#
# Description:
# The syslog-ng utility supports the ability to send logs it gathers to a remote log host or to
# receive messages from remote hosts, reducing administrative overhead.
#
# Rationale:
# Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker
# gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is
# stored on the local system
#
# @summary 4.2.2.4 Ensure syslog-ng is configured to send logs to a remote log host (Not Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
# @param logging How logging is done
# @param logging_host Which host should logging be sent to
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::redhat7::cis_4_2_2_4
