# 5.2.10 Ensure SSH PermitUserEnvironment is disabled (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The PermitUserEnvironment option allows users to present environment options to the ssh daemon.
#
# Rationale:
# Permitting users the ability to set environment variables through the SSH daemon could potentially allow users to bypass security
# controls (e.g. setting an execution path that has ssh executing trojan'd programs)
#
# @summary 5.2.10 Ensure SSH PermitUserEnvironment is disabled (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::redhat7::cis_5_2_10
class secure_linux_cis::redhat7::cis_5_2_10 (
  Boolean $enforced = true,
