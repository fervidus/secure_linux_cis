# 5.4.1.2 Ensure minimum days between password changes is 7 or more (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to prevent users from changing their password until a minimum
# number of days have passed since the last time the user changed their password. It is recommended that PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter be set to
# 7 or more days.
#
# Rationale:
# By restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can prevent users from repeatedly changing their password in an
# attempt to circumvent password reuse controls.
#
# @summary 5.4.1.2 Ensure minimum days between password changes is 7 or more (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
# @param pass_min_days Password minimum days
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::redhat7::cis_5_4_1_2
