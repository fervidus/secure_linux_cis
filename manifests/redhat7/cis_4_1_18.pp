# 4.1.18 Ensure the audit configuration is immutable (Scored)
#
# Description: 
# Set system audit so that audit rules cannot be modified with auditctl.
# Setting the flag "-e 2" forces audit to be put in immutable mode. Audit changes can only be made
# on system reboot. 
#
# Rationale: 
# In immutable mode, unauthorized users cannot execute changes to the audit system
# to potentially hide malicious activity and then put the audit rules back.
# Users would most likely notice a system reboot and that could alert administrators of an attempt
# to make unauthorized audit changes. 
#
# @summary 4.1.18 Ensure the audit configuration is immutable (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::redhat7::cis_4_1_18
