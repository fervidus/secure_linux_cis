# 5.2.7 Ensure SSH HostbasedAuthentication is disabled (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The HostbasedAuthentication parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through trusted hosts via the user of .rhosts , or
# /etc/hosts.equiv , along with successful public key client host authentication. This option only applies to SSH Protocol Version 2.
#
# Rationale:
# Even though the .rhosts files are ineffective if support is disabled in /etc/pam.conf , disabling the ability to use .rhosts files in SSH
# provides an additional layer of protection .
#
# @summary 5.2.7 Ensure SSH HostbasedAuthentication is disabled (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::redhat7::cis_5_2_7
