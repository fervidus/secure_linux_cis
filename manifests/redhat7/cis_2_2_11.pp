# 2.2.11 Ensure IMAP and POP3 server is not enabled (Scored)
#
# Description:
# dovecot is an open source IMAP and POP3 server for Linux based systems.
#
# Rationale:
# Unless POP3 and/or IMAP servers are to be provided by this system,
# it is recommended that the service be disabled to reduce the potential attack surface.
#
# @summary 2.2.11 Ensure IMAP and POP3 server is not enabled (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::redhat7::cis_2_2_11
