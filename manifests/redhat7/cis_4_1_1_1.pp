# 4.1.1.1 Ensure audit log storage size is configured (Not Scored)
#
# Description:
# Configure the maximum size of the audit log file. Once the log reaches the maximum size, it
# will be rotated and a new log file will be started.
#
# Rationale:
# It is important that an appropriate size is determined for log files so that they do not impact
# the system and audit data is not lost.
#
# @summary 4.1.1.1 Ensure audit log storage size is configured (Not Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
# @param max_log_file The maximum size of the audit log file (MB) for your organization's policy.
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::redhat7::cis_4_1_1_1
