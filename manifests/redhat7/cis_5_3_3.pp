# 5.3.3 Ensure password reuse is limited (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The /etc/security/opasswd file stores the users' old passwords and can be checked to ensure that users are not recycling recent passwords.
#
# Rationale:
# Forcing users not to reuse their past 5 passwords make it less likely that an attacker will be able to guess the password.
#
# Note that these change only apply to accounts configured on the local system.
#
