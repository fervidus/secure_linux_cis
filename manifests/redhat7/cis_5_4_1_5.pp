# 5.4.1.5 Ensure all users last password change date is in the past (Scored)
#
# Description:
# All users should have a password change date in the past.
#
# Rationale:
# If a users recorded password change date is in the future then they could bypass any set password expiration.
#
# @summary 5.4.1.5 Ensure all users last password change date is in the past (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::redhat7::cis_5_4_1_5
