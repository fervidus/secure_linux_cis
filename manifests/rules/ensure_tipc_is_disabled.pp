#  Ensure TIPC is disabled (Not Scored)
#
# # Description:
# The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol is designed to provide
# communication between cluster nodes.
#
# Rationale:
# If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module not be loaded,
# disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface.
#
# @summary  Ensure TIPC is disabled (Not Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_tipc_is_disabled

class secure_linux_cis::rules::ensure_tipc_is_disabled {

  kmod::install { 'tipc':
    command => '/bin/true',
  }
