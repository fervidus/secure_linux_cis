# 2 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is
# set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax variable is set,
# sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent
# with no response from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the
# ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time.
#
# Rationale:
# Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user
# walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening..
#
# While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy. The recommended setting for
# ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will
# be sent.
