#  Ensure rsyslog or syslog-ng is installed (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The rsyslog and syslog-ng software are recommended replacements to the original
# syslogd daemon which provide improvements over syslogd , such as connection-oriented
# (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of
# log data en route to a central logging server.
#
# Rationale:
# The security enhancements of rsyslog and syslog-ng such as connection-oriented (i.e.
# TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log
# data en route to a central logging server) justify installing and configuring the package.
