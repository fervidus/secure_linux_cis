#  Ensure NFS and RPC are not enabled (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The Network File System (NFS) is one of the first and most widely distributed file systems in the UNIX environment.
# It provides the ability for systems to mount file systems of other servers through the network.
#
# Rationale:
# If the system does not export NFS shares or act as an NFS client,
# it is recommended that these services be disabled to reduce remote attack surface.
#
# @summary  Ensure NFS and RPC are not enabled (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_nfs_and_rpc_are_not_enabled

class secure_linux_cis::rules::ensure_nfs_and_rpc_are_not_enabled {

  $nfs_services = [
    'nfs',
    'nfs-server',
    'rpcbind',
  ]

  service { $nfs_services:
    ensure => stopped,
    enable => false,
  }
