# 3 Ensure successful file system mounts are collected (Scored)
#
# Description:
# Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount ) system call controls the
# mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to
# create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user
#
# Rationale:
# It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While
# tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media
# may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's
# an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the
# media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also
# have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a
# file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair
# indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track
# successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the
# audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track
# data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.
