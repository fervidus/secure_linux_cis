#  Ensure SSH MaxAuthTries is set to 4 or less (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The MaxAuthTries parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts permitted per connection. When the login failure count
# reaches half the number, error messages will be written to the syslog file detailing the login failure.
#
# Rationale:
# Setting the MaxAuthTries parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the SSH server. While the
# recommended setting is 4, set the number based on site policy.
#
# @summary  Ensure SSH MaxAuthTries is set to 4 or less (Scored)

# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
# @param max_auth_tries How many authorization attempts to allow
