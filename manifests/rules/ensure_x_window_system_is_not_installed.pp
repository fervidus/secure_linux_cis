#  Ensure X Window System is not installed (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The X Window System provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where users can have multiple windows
# in which to run programs and various add on. The X Windows system is typically used on workstations where users login,
# but not on servers where users typically do not login.
#
# Rationale:
# Unless your organization specifically requires graphical login access via X Windows, remove it to reduce the potential attack surface.
#
# @summary  Ensure X Window System is not installed (Scored)
#
# @param enforced
#   Should this rule be enforced - defaults to false - test before enabling as some xorg packages may be required as dependancies.
#   See exclude param if you need to exclude packages from removal
#
# @param exclude
#   Optional Array of xorg packages to NOT remove. This may want to be used if specific xorg packages are required as dependancies.
#   Must match exactly with the package name obtained through the xorg_x11_packages fact.
