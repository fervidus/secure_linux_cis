# 7 Ensure rsh server is not enabled (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The Berkeley rsh-server ( rsh , rlogin , rexec ) package contains legacy services that exchange credentials in clear-text.
#
# Rationale:
# These legacy services contain numerous security exposures and have been replaced with the more secure SSH package.
#
# @summary 7 Ensure rsh server is not enabled (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_rsh_server_is_not_enabled

class secure_linux_cis::rules::ensure_rsh_server_is_not_enabled {

  $rsh_services = [
    'rsh.socket',
    'rlogin.socket',
    'rexec.socket',
  ]

  service { $rsh_services:
    ensure => stopped,
    enable => false,
  }
