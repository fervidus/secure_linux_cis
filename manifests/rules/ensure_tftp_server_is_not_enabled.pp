# 0 Ensure tftp server is not enabled (Scored)
#
# Description:
# Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple file transfer protocol,
# typically used to automatically transfer configuration or boot machines from a boot server.
# The package tftp-server is used to define and support a TFTP server.
#
# Rationale:
# TFTP does not support authentication nor does it ensure the confidentiality or integrity of data.
# It is recommended that TFTP be removed, unless there is a specific need for TFTP.
# In that case, extreme caution must be used when configuring the services.
#
# @summary 0 Ensure tftp server is not enabled (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_tftp_server_is_not_enabled

class secure_linux_cis::rules::ensure_tftp_server_is_not_enabled {

  service { 'tftp.socket':
    ensure => stopped,
    enable => false,
  }
