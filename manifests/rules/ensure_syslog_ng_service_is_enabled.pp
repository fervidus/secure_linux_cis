#  Ensure syslog-ng service is enabled (Scored)
#
# Description:
# Once the syslog-ng package is installed it needs to be activated.
#
# Rationale:
# If the syslog-ng service is not activated the system may default to the syslogd service or
# lack logging instead.
#
# @summary  Ensure syslog-ng service is enabled (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
# @param logging How logging is done
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_syslog_ng_service_is_enabled

class secure_linux_cis::rules::ensure_syslog_ng_service_is_enabled {

  if $::secure_linux_cis::logging == 'syslog-ng' {

    service { 'syslog-ng':
      ensure => running,
      enable => true,
    }
  }
}
