#  Ensure permissions on /etc/hosts.allow are configured (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The /etc/hosts.allow file contains networking information that is used by many
# applications and therefore must be readable for these applications to operate.
#
# Rationale:
# It is critical to ensure that the /etc/hosts.allow file is protected from unauthorized write
# access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either
# inadvertently or through malicious actions.
#
