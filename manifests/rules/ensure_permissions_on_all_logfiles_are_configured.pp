# Ensure permissions on all logfiles are configured (Scored)

# Description:
# Log files stored in /var/log/ contain logged information from many services on the system,
# or on log hosts others as well.
#
# Rationale:
# It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive
# data is archived and protected.
#
# @summary Ensure permissions on all logfiles are configured (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
# @param exclude_logs Array of logs to exclude from permissions enforcement
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_permissions_on_all_logfiles_are_configured
