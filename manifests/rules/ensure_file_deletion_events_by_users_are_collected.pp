# 4 Ensure file deletion events by users are collected (Scored)
#
# Description:
# Monitor the use of system calls associated with the deletion or renaming of files and file
# attributes. This configuration statement sets up monitoring for the unlink (remove a file),
# unlinkat (remove a file attribute), rename (rename a file) and renameat (rename a file
# attribute) system calls and tags them with the identifier "delete".
#
# Rationale:
# Monitoring these calls from non-privileged users could provide a system administrator
# with evidence that inappropriate removal of files and file attributes associated with
# protected files is occurring. While this audit option will look at all events, system
# administrators will want to look for specific privileged files that are being deleted or
# altered.
