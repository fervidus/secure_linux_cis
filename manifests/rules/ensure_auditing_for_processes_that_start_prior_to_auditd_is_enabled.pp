#  Ensure auditing for processes that start prior to auditd is enabled (Scored)
#
# Description:
# Configure grub so that processes that are capable of being audited can be audited even if
# they start up prior to auditd startup.
#
# Rationale:
# Audit events need to be captured on processes that start up prior to auditd, so that
# potential malicious activity cannot go undetected.
#
# @summary A short summary of the purpose of this class
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
