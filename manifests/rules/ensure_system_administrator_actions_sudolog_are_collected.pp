# 6 Ensure system administrator actions (sudolog) are collected (Scored)
#
# Description:
# Monitor the sudo log file. If the system has been properly configured to disable the use of
# the su command and force all administrators to have to log in first and then use sudo to
# execute privileged commands, then all administrator commands will be logged to
# /var/log/sudo.log . Any time a command is executed, an audit event will be triggered as
# the /var/log/sudo.log file will be opened for write and the executed administration
# command will be written to the log.
#
# Rationale:
# Changes in /var/log/sudo.log indicate that an administrator has executed a command or
# the log file itself has been tampered with. Administrators will want to correlate the events
# written to the audit trail with the records written to /var/log/sudo.log to verify if
# unauthorized commands have been executed.
