#  Ensure SSH Protocol is set to 2 (Scored)
#
# Description:
# SSH supports two different and incompatible protocols: SSH1 and SSH2. SSH1 was
# the original protocol and was subject to security issues. SSH2 is more advanced
# and secure.
#
# Rationale:
# SSH v1 suffers from insecurities that do not affect SSH v2.
#
# @summary  Ensure SSH Protocol is set to 2 (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_ssh_protocol_is_set_to_2

class secure_linux_cis::rules::ensure_ssh_protocol_is_set_to_2 {

  include ::secure_linux_cis::service
