#  Ensure all users last password change date is in the past (Scored)
#
# Description:
# All users should have a password change date in the past.
#
# Rationale:
# If a users recorded password change date is in the future then they could bypass any set password expiration.
#
# @summary  Ensure all users last password change date is in the past (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_all_users_last_password_change_date_is_in_the_past

class secure_linux_cis::rules::ensure_all_users_last_password_change_date_is_in_the_past {
  # local_users fact may be undef
  $local_users = pick($facts['local_users'], {})

  $local_users.each |String $user, Hash $attributes| {

    if !$attributes['password_date_valid'] {
      # fail("User ${user} has a password last changed date in the future. Please investigate.")
      notify { "plcd ${user}":
