#  Audit system file permissions (Not Scored)
#
# Description:
# The RPM package manager has a number of useful options.
# One of these, the --verify (or - V ) option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The --verify option can
# be used to verify a particular package
# or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning
# of output from the verify option:
#
# Rationale:
# It is important to confirm that packaged system files and directories are
# maintained with the permissions they were intended to have from the OS vendor.
