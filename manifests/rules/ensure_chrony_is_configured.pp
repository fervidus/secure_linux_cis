#  Ensure chrony is configured (Scored)
#
# Description:
# chrony is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP) is designed to
# synchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use a source that is highly
# accurate. More information on chrony can be found at http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/. chrony
# can be configured to be a client and/or a server.
#
# Rationale:
# If chrony is in use on the system proper configuration is vital to ensuring time
# synchronization is working properly.
# This recommendation only applies if chrony is in use on the system.
#
# @summary  Ensure chrony is configured (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
# @param time_servers Array of valid NTP Time servers
# @param time_sync Which NTP program to use
