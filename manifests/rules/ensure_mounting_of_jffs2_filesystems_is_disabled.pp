#  Ensure mounting of jffs2 filesystems is disabled (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The jffs2 (journaling flash filesystem 2) filesystem type is a log-structured filesystem used in flash memory devices.
#
# Rationale:
# Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system.
# If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
#
# @summary  Ensure mounting of jffs2 filesystems is disabled (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_mounting_of_jffs2_filesystems_is_disabled

class secure_linux_cis::rules::ensure_mounting_of_jffs2_filesystems_is_disabled {

  kmod::install { 'jffs2':
