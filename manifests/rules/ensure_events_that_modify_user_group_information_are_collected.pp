#  Ensure events that modify user/group information are collected (Scored)
#
# Description:
# Record events affecting the group , passwd (user IDs), shadow and gshadow (passwords) or
# /etc/security/opasswd (old passwords, based on remember parameter in the PAM
# configuration) files. The parameters in this section will watch the files to see if they have
# been opened for write or have had attribute changes (e.g. permissions) and tag them with
# the identifier "identity" in the audit log file.
#
# Rationale:
# Unexpected changes to these files could be an indication that the system has been
# compromised and that an unauthorized user is attempting to hide their activities or
# compromise additional accounts.
#
# @summary  Ensure events that modify user/group information are collected (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_events_that_modify_user_group_information_are_collected
