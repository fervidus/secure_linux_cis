# 5 Ensure SSH warning banner is configured (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The Banner parameter specifies a file whose contents must be sent to the remote user before authentication is permitted. By default, no
# banner is displayed.
#
# Rationale:
# Banners are used to warn connecting users of the particular site's policy regarding connection. Presenting a warning message prior to the
# normal user login may assist the prosecution of trespassers on the computer system.
#
# @summary 5 Ensure SSH warning banner is configured (Scored)
