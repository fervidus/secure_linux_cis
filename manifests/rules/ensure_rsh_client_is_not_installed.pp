#  Ensure rsh client is not installed (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The rsh package contains the client commands for the rsh services.
#
# Rationale:
# These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have been replaced with the more secure SSH package.
# Even if the server is removed, it is best to ensure the clients are also removed to prevent users from inadvertently attempting
# to use these commands and therefore exposing their credentials.
# Note that removing the rsh package removes the clients for rsh , rcp and rlogin .
#
# @summary  Ensure rsh client is not installed (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_rsh_client_is_not_installed
