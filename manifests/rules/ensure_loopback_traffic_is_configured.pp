#  Ensure loopback traffic is configured (Scored)
#
# Description:
# Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. Configure all other interfaces to deny
# traffic to the loopback network (/8).
#
# Rationale:
# Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to
# operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network
# (/8) traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this
# network as an anti-spoofing measure.
#
# @summary  Ensure loopback traffic is configured (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_loopback_traffic_is_configured
