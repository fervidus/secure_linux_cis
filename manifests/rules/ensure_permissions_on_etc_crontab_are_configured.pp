#  Ensure permissions on /etc/crontab are configured (Scored)
#
#
# Description:
# The /etc/crontab file is used by cron to control its own jobs. The commands in
# this item make sure that root is the user and group owner of the file and that
# only the owner can access the file.
#
# Rationale:
# This file contains information on what system jobs are run by cron. Write access
# to these files could provide unprivileged users with the ability to elevate
# their privileges. Read access to these files could provide users with the
# ability to gain insight on system jobs that run on the system and could provide
# them a way to gain unauthorized privileged access.
#
# @summary  Ensure permissions on /etc/crontab are configured (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_permissions_on_etc_crontab_are_configured
