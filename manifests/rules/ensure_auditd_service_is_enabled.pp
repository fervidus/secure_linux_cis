#
# Description:
# Turn on the auditd daemon to record system events.

# them to determine if unauthorized access to their system is occurring.
#
# @summary  Ensure auditd service is enabled (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_auditd_service_is_enabled

  # Also ensuring the package is installed before the service
  package { $::secure_linux_cis::auditd_package:
    ensure => installed,
    before => Service['auditd'],
  }

  service { 'auditd':
