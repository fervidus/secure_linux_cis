#  Ensure local login warning banner is configured properly (Not Scored)
#
# Description:
# The contents of the /etc/issue file are displayed to users prior to login for local terminals.
# Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch level upon logging in to the
# system. This information can be useful to developers who are developing software for a particular OS platform. If mingetty(8)
# supports the following options, they display operating system information: \m - machine architecture \r - operating system release
# \s - operating system name \v - operating system version
#
# @summary  Ensure local login warning banner is configured properly (Not Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_local_login_warning_banner_is_configured_properly

class secure_linux_cis::rules::ensure_local_login_warning_banner_is_configured_properly {
