# 3 Audit SUID executables (Not Scored)
#
#
# Description:
# The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's permissions, even if the user running the
# program is not the owner or a member of the group. The most common reason for a SUID program is to enable users to perform functions
# (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.
#
# @summary 3 Audit SUID executables (Not Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::audit_suid_executables

#
# NOTE: Not feasible for programatic enforcement
#

  # if $facts['suid_files'] {
  #   notify { 'sf':
  #     message  => '[3] (Not Scored) SUID files found. Check the suid_files
  #     fact and ensure all files are authorized.', #lint:ignore:140chars
