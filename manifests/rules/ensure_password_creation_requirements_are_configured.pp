#  Ensure password creation requirements are configured (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The pam_pwquality.so module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word,
# it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more. The following are definitions of the
# pam_pwquality .so options.
#
#   try_first_pass - retrieve the password from a previous stacked PAM module. If not available, then prompt the user for a password.
#   retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.
#
# The following options are set in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file:
#   minlen = 14 - password must be 14 characters or more
#   dcredit = -1 - provide at least one digit
#   ucredit = -1 - provide at least one uppercase character
#   ocredit = -1 - provide at least one special character
#   lcredit = -1 - provide at least one lowercase character
#
# The settings shown above are one possible policy. Alter these values to conform to your own organization's password policies.
#
# Rationale:
# Strong passwords protect systems from being hacked through brute force methods.
#
