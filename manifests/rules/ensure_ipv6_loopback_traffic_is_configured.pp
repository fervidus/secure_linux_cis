# Ensure IPv6 loopback traffic is configured (Scored)
#
# Description:
# Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. Configure all other interfaces to deny
# traffic to the loopback network (::1).
#
# Rationale:
# Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to
# operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network
# (::1) traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this
# network as an anti-spoofing measure.
#
# @summary Ensure IPv6 loopback traffic is configured (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::rules::ensure_ipv6_loopback_traffic_is_configured
class secure_linux_cis::rules::ensure_ipv6_loopback_traffic_is_configured (
  Boolean $enforced = true,
) {
