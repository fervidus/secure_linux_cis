#  Ensure session initiation information is collected (Scored)
#
# Description:
# Monitor session initiation events. The parameters in this section track changes to the files
# associated with session events. The file /var/run/utmp file tracks all currently logged in
# users. All audit records will be tagged with the identifier "session." The /var/log/wtmp file
# tracks logins, logouts, shutdown, and reboot events. The file /var/log/btmp keeps track of
# failed login attempts and can be read by entering the command /usr/bin/last -f
# /var/log/btmp . All audit records will be tagged with the identifier "logins."
#
# Rationale:
# Monitoring these files for changes could alert a system administrator to logins occurring at
# unusual hours, which could indicate intruder activity (i.e. a user logging in at a time when
# they do not normally log in).
