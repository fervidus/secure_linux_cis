#  Ensure packet redirect sending is disabled (Scored)
#
# Description:
# ICMP Redirects are used to send routing information to other hosts.
# As a host itself does not act as a router (in a host only configuration), there is no need to send redirects.
#
# Rationale:
# An attacker could use a compromised host to send invalid ICMP redirects to other router devices in an attempt
# to corrupt routing and have users access a system set up by the attacker as opposed to a valid system.
#
# @summary  Ensure packet redirect sending is disabled (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_packet_redirect_sending_is_disabled
