#  Ensure XD/NX support is enabled (Not Scored)
#
#
# Description:
# Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis.
# Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD).
# This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible.
# Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such
# as # Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature.
#
# @summary  Ensure XD/NX support is enabled (Not Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_xd_nx_support_is_enabled

class secure_linux_cis::rules::ensure_xd_nx_support_is_enabled {

  if(! $facts['nx_dmesg']) {
    notify { 'NX':
      message  => '[] (Not Scored) Please run "dmesg | grep NX" and verify that No Execute (or Execute Disable, for some Intel
        processors) protection is enabled', #lint:ignore:140chars
    }
  }
