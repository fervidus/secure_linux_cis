# 2 Ensure use of privileged commands is collected (Scored)
#
# Description:
# Monitor privileged programs (those that have the setuid and/or setgid
# bit set on execution) to determine if unprivileged users are running
# these commands.
#
# Rationale:
# Execution of privileged commands by non-privileged users could be an
# indication of someone trying to gain unauthorized access to the system.
#
# @summary 2 Ensure use of privileged commands is collected (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_use_of_privileged_commands_is_collected
