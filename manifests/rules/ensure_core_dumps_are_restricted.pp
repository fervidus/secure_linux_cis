#  Ensure core dumps are restricted (Scored)
#
#
# Description:
# A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can
# also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps,
# but this can be overridden by the user.
#
# @summary  Ensure core dumps are restricted (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_core_dumps_are_restricted
