#  Ensure wireless interfaces are disabled (Not Scored)
#
# Description:
# Wireless networking is used when wired networks are unavailable. Red Hat Enterprise
# Linux 7 contains a wireless tool kit to allow system administrators to configure and use
# wireless networks.
#
# Rationale:
# If wireless is not to be used, wireless devices can be disabled to reduce the potential attack
# surface.
#
# @summary  Ensure wireless interfaces are disabled (Not Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_wireless_interfaces_are_disabled
