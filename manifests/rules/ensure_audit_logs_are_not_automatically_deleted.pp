#  Ensure audit logs are not automatically deleted (Scored)
#
# Description:
# The max_log_file_action setting determines how to handle the audit log file reaching the
# max file size. A value of keep_logs will rotate the logs but never delete old logs.
#
# Rationale:
# In high security contexts, the benefits of maintaining a long audit history exceed the cost of
# storing the audit history.
#
# @summary  Ensure audit logs are not automatically deleted (Scored)
#
# @param enforced Should this rule be enforced
#
# @example
#   include secure_linux_cis::ensure_audit_logs_are_not_automatically_deleted

    line   => 'max_log_file_action = keep_logs',
