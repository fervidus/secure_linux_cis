## Release 1.0.14
Thanks to Bart-Jan Vrielink for fixing our spec test.

## Release 1.0.13
* Added AIDE database renaming to cis_1_3_1 as 'aide --init' command creates a new temporary file requiring renaming
* Change cis_1_6_11 to use kernel_parameter instead of file_line to set 'quiet' in grub.cfg, to avoid entire line being overwritten in /etc/default/grub.cfg
* Add optional $motd parameter to be sole content of /etc/motd in cis_1_7_1_4.  If not defined and $banner is defined, $banner becomes content of /etc/motd
* Restore sysctl resources when disabling ipv6 in cis_3_3_1, cis_3_3_2 and cis_3_3_3, remove kernel_parameter from cis_3_3_3 as problematic when using sysctl to disable and check ipv6, add /etc/sysconfig/network entries
* Update cis_3_3_3 and cis_3_6_2 to allow ip6_tables to drop undefined traffic
* Fix typo in cis_5_3_1 of try_first_path instead of try_first_pass
* Remove nullok and add shadow to /etc/pam.d system-auth and password-auth in cis_5_3_3
* Remove all use of pkill, add rsyslog and rsyslog-ng classes to array of classes that trigger an opt-in reboot, as rsyslog can be (outside of this module) configured to halt system or boot into single mode if terminated
* Fix various custom fact scripts issues with missing .sh, false positives when home dir absent, reduce script file and directory permissions to 0700
* Update local_users custom fact to allow for users whose password needs to be changed
* Move location of custom fact scripts directory from /tmp/cis_scripts to /usr/share/cis_scripts as fail to execute if /tmp mounted noexec as per recommendations!
* Remove subscription_manager from dependencies as appears unused

## Release 1.0.12
* Fix cis_5_2_14 ssh DenyGroups typo
* Refactor remaining bash scripts using Shellcheck and test functions
* Replace sysctl resources with file_line in cis_3_3_1, cis_3_3_2 and cis_3_3_3 as sysctl fails to write to /proc/sys/net/ipv6 when  kernel_parameter ipv6.disable=1 in effect and system has been rebooted.  Kernel_parameter requires a reboot to have effect.
* Add shared resources block to end of centos7.pp and redhat7.pp to invoke service/system reload or restart only when notified
* Add parameter for auto_restart when defined classes make changes that require a reboot to take effect (defaults to false)
* Add optional parameter for banner which becomes the sole content of /etc/issue, /etc/issue.net and /etc/motd

## Release 1.0.11
* Create resource collector override to disable ip6tables in class cis_3_3_3 when ipv6 disabled
* Change default of ip6_enabled to false (ipv6 is now now opt-in)
* Increase max_log_file default size from 8 to 32Mb to satisfy Nessus scan
