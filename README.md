## Description

This Puppet module implements security controls defined in the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks for the below operating systems. The benchmark versions are listed below:

| Operating System | Benchmark Version |
|------------------|-------------------|
| RedHat 7 | 2.2.0 |
| CentOS 7 | 2.2.0 |

CIS Benchmarks can be found [here](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/centos_linux/).

## Setup

To start with Secure Linux and harden your server to CIS standards, declare the `secure_linux_cis::redhat7` class:

```Puppet
class {'::secure_linux_cis':}
```

The module will begin enforcement and reporting immediately and without breaking by default, but to reach full compliance please specify which users or groups to allow/deny access by specifying any one of the parameters shown below:

```Puppet
class {'::secure_linux_cis':
  $allow_users  => ['john','jacob','jeremiah']
  $allow_groups => 'root',
  $deny_users   => 'mark',
  $deny_groups  => 'external',
}
```

### No-Op Mode
It is possible to run the module in "No-Op Mode", which identifies detected Configuration Drifts without implementing any actual changes. This is useful for auditing the state of your system without making any changes.

```
puppet agent -t --noop
```

## Usage

### Disabling Vulnerabilities with Hiera

As of enforcement for the Redhat 7 OS, there are 223 CIS rules that are either enforced or documented. Each rule relates to a class which can be turned on or off according to the needs of the system. By default, all vulnerabilities are turned ON to ensure maximum security out-of-box. This is how you would turn off a vulnerablity using your company's Hiera configuration.

```yaml
# hieradata/common.yaml
secure_linux_cis::redhat7::cis_1_1_2::enforced: false
```

See [Limitations](#limitations) for a list of vulnerabilities that might not apply to certain system configurations

Any parameters that need to be explicitly defined can be done so in init.pp
